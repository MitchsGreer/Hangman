# Hangman
Hangman game implemented in C. Great to look over if you are trying to learn C as it has a wide array of library use and is not a complex game. This game has been developed in Linux and has not been tested in a windows envirenment.

You just need to clone the this repository into a directory and run the `Makfile` file. This will compile the code using the cc compiler.

1. Open a terminal
2. Navigate to the build directory in Hangman

The `Hangman` executable is now available to play!
